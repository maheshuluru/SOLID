# SOLID
Discuss about the SOLID Principles.

## SRP : Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one, and only one reason to change.
Each Class and Module in a program should focus on a single task.

## OCP : Open-Closed Principle
Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
Separate extensible behavior behind an interface, and flip the dependencies.

## LSP : Liskov Substitute Principle
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

## ISP : Interface Segregation Priniciple
A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use.

## DIP : Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
Dependency Injection is not equal to Dependency Inversion
High level module should not depends up on Low level module
Low level module also should not depend up on High level module.
